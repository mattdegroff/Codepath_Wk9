Week 9 Honeypot Assignment

I have been having trouble trying to access the console for mhn admin. Whenever I run the install.sh file everything installs directly and I use the defaults and then when I try to access the console, the browser says it could'nt connect. Still working on trying to get atleast 1 honeypot running.
